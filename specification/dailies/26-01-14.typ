== From interpreter to theory
When trying to retrofit a typesystem onto a language that is effectively defined by an interpreter, the natural question arises, how close one should model the interpreters behaviour. In many cases the interpreter needs to be followed closely, but in cases of "higher theoretical properties" like infinite-recursion it might be benefical to extrapolate or simplify the intepreter quirks, effectiely deviating from the instantiated operational semantic.
