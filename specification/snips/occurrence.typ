== Occurence Typing




== Impurities <impurities>
On the one hand nix is a pure and function language without sideffects but on the other hand it is one, that tightly integrates with the file-system to properly track built operations, their dependencies and outputs. The standard library thus boasts a few functions that make typing undecidable for systems that don't evaluate the language themselves.

`currentSystem, currentTime, fetch\*, findFile, langVersion, nixVersion` these functions can return arbitrary values. Since nix can use them them in combination with dynamic accesses, the type systems becomes an evaluator. We thus _need_ a gradual type system.
