- Are row-varibles actually better in gradual systems?


== Systems
- parreaux
- castagna
- Rows(Wand): No principality for record label overwriting
- Lacks(Remy): Only add if some qulifide type fits
- Scoped(Leijin): lifts uniqueness

(Gaster & jones: A polymorphic type system for extensible records and variants)

== Misc
The type systems that epitomizes this idea are typesystem called  _semantic subtyping_, mainly developed by Castagna et. al. The principal idea of this approach is to relate types to their set of inhabited types, that is, the set of types that can be given a specific type, in this regard giving types a _semantic meaning_. In the set-theoretic model of types, type-union relates to set-unions $⟦τ⟧ ∪ ⟦τ⟧$, type-intersection to set-intersections $⟦τ⟧∩⟦τ⟧$ and type negation to set-removal $𝟙 without ⟦τ⟧$.
